# TrajectoryPlot
Plot trajectory from csv

Step1: Import .csv file w/ time and position vector data.
We use logged time and position vector (x,y,z) as input.
Draw trajectory in a sequential order. 

Step2: Import top-view of image
Put image into the canvas and the trajectory will be visualized on it.

Extra: Grid count
For heatmap drawing, we provide countGrid function. It will export as csv file.
